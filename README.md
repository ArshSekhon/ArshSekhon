## 👋🏻 I'm Arsh Sekhon

I am a Software Developer with **more than 4 years of experience** of developing **enterprise scale software**.

### My Software Development Philosophy 💻💭
- Writing good software is more of a craft than a science. 
- Like any other crafts, it takes time, patience and practice to master it. 
- Each piece of code is a reflection of the artist/author and their skillset at the time they wrote it.

- Custom Mechanical Keyboards ⌨️ 
- Art & Graphics Design 🎨🖼 
- Linux Ricing and Customizations 🐧
- Cosmos (and our place in it) 🌌🚀
